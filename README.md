# Madelinux's SwayFX dotfiles
These are just my dotfiles for SwayFX. The theme is mostly Catppuccin Latte with some of the colors from Macchiato.
This contains themes for
- SwayFX (of course)
- Mako
- Fastfetch
- Waybar
- Fuzzel
<p>If you would like configs for anything else just create an issue and I'll probably add it.<br>
Feel free to use this however you like, I do not care.</p>
